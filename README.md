🚤 Ganga Boat Tracker

Ganga Boat Tracker is a web application that helps users easily find route-wise ferry timings across the Ganga River.
It is designed for students, working professionals, locals, and new commuters who rely on ferry services but face confusion due to changing schedules and high-tide pauses.

The platform simplifies ferry travel by highlighting the next available boat, showing high-tide pause timings, and visualizing ferry routes on an interactive map.
